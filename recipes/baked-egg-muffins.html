    <h2>Easy breakfast...that is so yummy!!</h2>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 slices bacon</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons maple syrup</li>
        <li>6 slices bread, crusts removed</li>
        <li>6 eggs</li>
        <li>salt and black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons heavy cream</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons shredded Cheddar cheese, or as desired</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate; crumble and set aside.</li>
        <li>Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease muffin cups.</li>
        <li>Combine the melted butter and maple syrup in a small bowl. Flatten a piece of bread with a rolling pin. Brush the bread with the butter mixture. Line the muffin cup with the flattened bread. Repeat with the remaining bread slices. Bake in a preheated oven until the bread crisps, about 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle crumbled bacon into the bottom of the toast cups. Crack an egg into each cup. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Top each egg with 1 tablespoon of heavy cream and 1 tablespoon cheese. Bake until the whites are just set, about 10 to 14 minutes or until the eggs are cooked to your taste.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
